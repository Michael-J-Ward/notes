## Markdown Replacement

### Why?

Markdown has several implementations available,
most implement the same core features but several useful features are missing.
Features as:

- Math support.
- Cross-referencing.
- While graph tools exist, support for them is non-standard.
- While it compiles to HTML, support for other possible languages is *hacky*.

### Principles

- Simple, readable language.
- Original file readability should be as good as the final product.
- Produce quality output documents, from a simple README to a full-fledged documentation system.
- It should scale, writing a file should be just writing a file.
- No imports, plugins or LaTeX like crap.
- UTF-8 support as well as Math symbols.
