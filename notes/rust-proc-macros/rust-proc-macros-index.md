# Rust Proc Macros

If you have been following my [[rust-typestate-index]] series,
you will know I've said the next step is to research Rust's proc macros.
Following on that promise, I present this companion series, where I explore proc macros and their implementation.

My aim is to implement all macros from David Tolnay's [`proc-macro-workshop`](https://github.com/dtolnay/proc-macro-workshop),
and document my adventure.
Eventually, writing a companion manual would be an amazing side effect of the effort.

Meanwhile, below you can find this series posts.
