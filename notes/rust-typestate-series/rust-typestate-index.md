# Rusty Typestates

This work is part of my thesis on behavioral types,
any kind of feedback is welcome and can be submitted as an issue to any of the repositories in the [`rustype` organization](https://github.com/rustype).
For further discussion, please contact me through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/duartejmg) or [Keybase](https://keybase.io/jmgduarte).

This series aims to be a kind of devlog where I explore typestates (maybe others as well)
and their implementation using the Rust type system.
