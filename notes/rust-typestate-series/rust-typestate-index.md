# Rusty Typestates

This work is part of my thesis on behavioral types,
suggestions are welcome and can be submitted as issues to any of the repositories in the `rustype` organization.
Any issues you wish to discuss further, please contact me through [Keybase](https://keybase.io/jmgduarte) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/duartejmg).

This series aims to be a kind of devlog where I explore typestates (maybe others as well)
and their implementation using the Rust type system.
